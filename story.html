        Whoo, whoo went the cold winds as walked past the graveyard not a sound only the warning hoot of an owl. As I walked past a recent grave I felt a strong presence of someone and a voice, a voice of a girl about my age helplessly calling someone to play with her. I ignored the voice and walked on but just in the distance about three feet away from me was a small girl with piercing blue eyes, rosy cheeks  and a wide smile plastered on her face I smiled back at her. She moved forward and held my hand. Her hands were as cold as ice. The clock struck 8 and there was a loud bang throughout the town. The girl looked at me and smiled and ‘Tomorrow’ was all she said and the voice  grew fainter and fainter until it faded away. I felt someone shake me when I opened my eyes I saw my mother beside me trying to wake me up.

        <p>Most children hate sleeping alone in the dark and I  too  am one of them. So dear readers I would like to give a clear and distinct description of the peculiar night when I saw an apparition.
            As usual   I was retiring to bed after watching my favorite   TV show.  When my mom suddenly snapped at me that whenever I enter the room her sleep gets disturbed and dear readers for your information I have a very sharp tongue. I retorted that if you get disturbed then you can happily go to the other room to sleep. She angrily stopped out of the room with her blanket and pillow and slammed the door shut. I started reading a book. I read for a while and decided to sleep. I switched off the night lamp and rested my head on the pillow. For five minutes nothing happened and I thought that I would be able to sleep without my mother but then I heard someone’s laughter and I covered my ears and hid under the blanket and closed my eyes and started praying. I then started remembering all the creepy figures and ghosts. Suddenly I heard a scampering noise. I thrust my head out of the blanket. I got the shock of my life. I saw something like an eye watching me. I was paralyzed with fear. I remembered the movie in which the ghost ate the girl alive. I had no time to lose. I had to act fast. I quickly reached out to the switch and turned the night lamp on but wait a second there was no ghost it was just a badminton set. I breathed a sigh of relief. I pleaded my mother to come back to the room before another ghost considered to eat me alive. I was so relieved. I rested my head on the pillow and laughed at my silliness. A week as elapsed and I still laugh at how a badminton set would eat me alive.
           ‘’ I am proud of myself that I survived for 10 minutes’’
